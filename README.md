# Synch-Talk: AI-Powered Chrome Side Panel for Fluent Multilingual Communication

## Project Overview

**Synch-Talk** is a groundbreaking Chrome side panel extension designed to revolutionize multilingual conversations. It goes beyond simple translation, acting as your personal AI language partner to ensure your communication is not just accurate, but also natural and culturally appropriate.

This project is currently in its initial development phase. We're leveraging Chrome's new built-in AI capabilities to rapidly build and validate our core features, focusing on a clean, simple user experience.

## Core Features

### 1. Multilingual Real-time Translation
Translate your text into multiple target languages simultaneously. This is perfect for group chats or conference calls where participants speak different native languages.

* **Initial Supported Languages (MVP):** Chinese, English, Greek.(Weâ€™re starting with languages that will truly push our AI to its limits. Bring it on!)

### 2. AI Polishing & Native Expression
Our core value proposition. The AI understands the context and rewrites your sentences to sound more like a native speaker, avoiding awkward, literal translations.

### 3. AI Tutor (Optional)
This is an enhancement mode for language learners. By toggling on the **AI Tutor**, the extension will first:

* **Correct Grammar & Spelling:** Automatically fix any grammatical and spelling errors in your input and show the corrected version.
* **Provide Reference Translation:** Offer a polished translation in your native language and English, helping you learn from your own mistakes.

## Technical Stack & Roadmap

### Phase 1 (MVP - Current Focus)
* **Goal:** Build a basic, functional prototype.
* **Technology:** We will primarily use the Chrome Extension API, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll utilize Chrome's new native AI features to streamline development and avoid a separate backend for initial validation.
* **Key Tasks:**
    * Set up the Chrome side panel UI.
    * Integrate with Chrome's built-in AI for basic translation and polishing.
    * Implement the core translation and a simple version of the AI Polishing feature for the three initial languages.

### Phase 2 & Beyond
Once the core functionality is validated, we will expand the project to include:
* Refined **AI Tutor** mode with interactive feedback.
* The **Reverse Check** feature for translation validation.
* Support for more languages, including **French, German, and Japanese**.
* Potential integration with a custom backend for more powerful AI models if needed.

## Contribution
